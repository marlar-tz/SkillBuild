# CM2020 Agile Software Projects 
## Application name - SkillBuild

### Introduction
This project is a team-developed web application designed to connect extracurricular freelance instructors with interested students. The platform allows instructors to create and manage their profiles, while students can easily search for instructors that best match their learning needs and preferences.

The application is built using technologies such as EJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Bootstrap, and SQLite3. As part of the development team, my role focused on frontend development, where I was responsible for creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, EJS, and Bootstrap.

Our goal is to make it easier for students to find suitable instructors for extracurricular learning while providing instructors a dedicated space to showcase their skills and offerings.
